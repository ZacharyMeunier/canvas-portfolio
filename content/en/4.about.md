A few words about me

#intro
I am a Game Development Student based in Quebec, Canada, currently studying at the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi, with hands-on experience creating games using Unreal Engine and Godot. Versatile and adaptable, I can contribute to both gameplay programming and the design and integration of user interfaces. Through academic projects and professional experiences, I have developed strong problem-solving skills and the ability to collaborate effectively within a team, while also strengthening my capacity to manage game projects independently and in an organized manner.
